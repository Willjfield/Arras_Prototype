# NOTES & QUESTIONS
- Where do we get pre-2000 census tracts?
- Pre-2020 ACS data included is dummy data! NOT REAL DATA
- HS or Equivalent field is slightly different in the actual data which only specifies *highest* level, not HS or greater
- Only ACS data included so far, not school level, do we definitely want this as points for schools rather than school district?
